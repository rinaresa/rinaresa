 About Me

- I'm currently a *Backend Development track learner at ALX Software Engineering Program*
- I started software engineering because of my love for problem-solving, building impactful systems, and creating tech that empowers communities.
- I am deeply inspired by the idea that *asking “why” leads to clarity, accountability, and innovation*.
- My mission is to build tools and platforms that help people *understand, question, and interact with systems openly and fearlessly*.

 My Vision

To become a backend engineer who builds secure, scalable, and human-centered applications — especially in the areas of:

- Digital inclusion
- Cultural preservation
- Community empowerment
- Transparent systems
